Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Open LaTeX Studio - an open source, Java based LaTeX editor.

gettting started, in case you have already found something to work on.

We are currently looking for:
* **Java developers**
  * Either experienced programmers or people taking their first steps in Java
  * Your task will be to add new features to the editor or fix bugs
  * We have issues of various difficulty levels
  * Your code will be validated by experienced programmer, so you can get actual feedback about your solution
  
* **Testers**
  * Either experienced testers or people that want to get their first testing experience
  * Your task will mostly cover testing the application and suggesting new features
  * In case you have little experience with testing, we will help you learn how to write a good bug report or issue request
